      <h2 id="chefhighlight">Our Chef, Evan!</h2>
      <img src="./images/chef.jpg" />
      <p>
        Evan was born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona. He started cooking in his
        own kitchen with his parents at the young age of 6. His parents always
        encouraged him to try new things and take risks with his cooking. By the
        time he had graduated high school, he new he wanted to go into the
        culinary arts field.
      </p>
      <p>
        Evan was accepted into The Culinary School of America in Hyde Park, New
        York right out of high school. He knew that he wanted to get the best
        possible training he could and was dedicated to learning all he could
        from others. He graduated at the top of his class and honors from the
        staff. Once he graduated, he wanted to move closer to family to work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once Evan moved to the Tampa Bay area, he found work at some of the best
        restaurants in the area. After he dined at Midnight Grill one evening,
        he saw that the restaurants kitchen was not putting out the best food it
        could. He decided to talk with the owner and offer his assistance to the
        kitchen staff in order to improve the menu. Now after 5 years at the
        restaurant, he has fallen in love with the new menu he helped create and
        loves the beach side location in Pass-a-Grille. He decided to stay and
        continue serving his custom menu to the servers and still enjoys it to
        this day!

    <!--About Us section-->
    <section>
      <h2 id="aboutsection">About The Midnight Grill</h2>
      <p>
        The Midnight Grill was founded in 1985. We wanted to create a restaurant
        that serves amazing food at amazing prices. Since day one, we have been
        on a mission to find the very best comfort food and make it our own. We
        take your favorite dishes and add a little of our own flair to make a
        unique dish. The menu items may look like your standard fare, but the
        taste is very unique!
        <br /><br />
        Our goal is to make your night out as special as possible by giving you
        a wide selection of food while keeping the prices low so that you don't
        have to worry about ordering the cheapest thing on the menu! Please come
        on by and have a bowl of delicious Green Chile Stew and see for yourself
        how comfort food should be!
